# 📐 Wireframing

## 🧭 Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the UI/UX design process that serves as the **blueprint** of a digital product such as a website or application. It provides a **visual guide** that represents the skeletal framework of a user interface before any design elements like colors, images, or fonts are applied.

Wireframes focus on:
- Structure
- Layout
- User flow
- Functionality

They help in translating abstract ideas into visual representations that are easy to analyze, test, and communicate with both team members and stakeholders.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Ideas Early**: Helps translate concepts into tangible visuals before investing in high-fidelity designs.
- **Enhances Team Communication**: Aligns designers, developers, and clients with a common visual understanding.
- **Identifies Usability Issues**: Reveals navigation or layout flaws before development starts.
- **Saves Time & Money**: Detecting and fixing issues at the wireframe stage is more efficient than after development.
- **Improves User Experience**: Ensures user flows are logical and intuitive.
